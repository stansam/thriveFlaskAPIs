reanalyse each and every one of the files inside the app/models/ folder by countercheking total files in that directory and reading each and every one. After you have successfully analysed each and every model present, seperately create a repository-workflows.md file and a service-workflows.md file, saving them locally in the project root folder. This files respectively are to have, in point-form, an exhaustive list of all the custom repository(db) level class based functions and an exhaustive list of all the custom service level class based functions possible for the full completion of the professional, enterprise level web app backend.
